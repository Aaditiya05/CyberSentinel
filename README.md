# CyberSentinel
# 🛡️ CyberSentinel-AI

Autonomous AI agents for real-time cyber threat detection and mitigation using reinforcement learning and network simulations.

## 🚀 Overview

CyberSentinel simulates a dynamic computer network where cyberattacks can spread, and AI agents learn to detect and contain them. It aims to model:
- **Autonomous threat detection**
- **Multi-agent decision making**
- **Reinforcement learning and graph-based intelligence**

This project is inspired by the need for AI-driven cybersecurity in large-scale, decentralized systems.

## 📌 Phase 1: Network Simulation and Attack Spread

### ✅ What’s implemented:
- Simulated computer network as a graph (nodes = devices, edges = connections)
- Randomized cyberattack starting point and spread pattern
- Visualization of infected vs. safe nodes over time

### 🖥️ Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- NetworkX (graph modeling)
- Matplotlib (basic visualization)

### 📸 Sample Output
